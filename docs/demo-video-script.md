# Architectural Alchemist - Demo Video Script (4 Minutes)

## Video Structure and Timing

### Opening (0:00 - 0:30)
**Problem Introduction**

*Visuals:*
- Split screen showing traditional interior design tools (static photos, text boxes)
- Person frustrated with clunky interface
- Quick cuts of multiple failed design attempts

*Voiceover:*
"Traditional AI design tools trap you in text boxes and static photos. You describe your space, upload pictures, and wait for generic suggestions. But what if your AI could see your space, hear your ideas, and respond in real-time?"

*Visuals:*
- Title card: "Architectural Alchemist"
- Live video feed showing room with person moving
- Real-time analysis overlay appearing

*Voiceover:*
"Meet Architectural Alchemist - a next-generation AI agent that breaks free from the text box paradigm. Using Gemini Live API and ADK integration, we've created a truly live architectural assistant."

### Core Features Demo (0:30 - 2:30)
**Natural Voice Interaction**

*Visuals:*
- Person walking through living room with phone/tablet
- Speaking naturally: "I'm thinking of painting this wall a different color"
- AI responds immediately through speakers
- Real-time analysis overlay showing wall identification

*Voiceover:*
"Talk naturally as you move through your space. Our agent hears your ideas and sees your surroundings through live video streaming. No typing, no waiting - just seamless conversation."

**Spatial Analysis Demo**

*Visuals:*
- Person taps on wall in video feed
- Instant popup: "Wall detected - Drywall, white paint, excellent for color transformation"
- Person taps on floor: "Hardwood floor, good condition, consider area rug for warmth"
- Person points to ceiling: "Popcorn ceiling, could be modernized with minimal effort"

*Voiceover:*
"Click any surface for instant AI analysis. Our agent identifies materials, conditions, and transformation possibilities using Gemini 1.5 Pro's spatial reasoning capabilities."

**Interruption Handling**

*Visuals:*
- AI is mid-sentence suggesting design options
- Person interrupts: "Wait, what about that corner over there?"
- AI immediately pauses, acknowledges: "Good point! Let me analyze that corner area..."
- AI provides new analysis for corner

*Voiceover:*
"Real conversations have interruptions. Our agent handles them gracefully using ADK-powered conversation management. No more waiting for the AI to finish - just interrupt naturally."

**Privacy Protection**

*Visuals:*
- Split screen: Original video vs. processed video
- Person walks into frame - face detection boxes appear
- Automatic blur applied to faces
- Privacy shield indicator: "2 faces detected, privacy protection active"

*Voiceover:*
"Privacy is fundamental. Our built-in Privacy Shield automatically detects and blurs faces before any processing. Crowd scenes are blocked entirely, and all images are processed server-side for maximum security."

### Technical Innovation (2:30 - 3:30)
**ADK Integration**

*Visuals:*
- Code overlay showing ADK agent architecture
- Tool-based system visualization
- Real-time data flow diagram

*Voiceover:*
"Built with Google's Agent Development Kit, our system uses a tool-based architecture for extensibility. Custom tools for architectural analysis, privacy protection, and conversation management work together seamlessly."

**Cloud Deployment**

*Visuals:*
- Terraform code snippets
- Cloud Run console showing deployed service
- Live deployment logs
- Service URL and health check

*Voiceover:*
"Deployed on Google Cloud Run with infrastructure as code. Our Terraform configuration provisions everything automatically - from storage buckets to Firestore databases to the AI services themselves."

**Gemini Live API**

*Visuals:*
- WebRTC connection visualization
- Real-time audio/video streaming indicators
- Low latency measurements (<200ms)

*Voiceover:*
"The magic happens through Gemini Live API - real-time multimodal interaction that processes video and audio simultaneously. This isn't turn-based chat; this is genuine conversation with your AI assistant."

### Value Proposition (3:30 - 4:00)
**Problem Solved**

*Visuals:*
- Before/after comparison: Static tools vs. Live interaction
- User testimonials (quick quotes)
- Final shot of beautifully transformed room

*Voiceover:*
"We solved the fundamental problem of real-time architectural guidance. Instead of describing your space to an AI that can't see, you now have an assistant that experiences your environment with you."

**Unique Value**

*Visuals:*
- Feature comparison table vs. competitors
- Privacy protection highlights
- Live interaction benefits

*Voiceover:*
"Architectural Alchemist combines live interaction, intelligent spatial analysis, and uncompromising privacy protection. It's not just another design tool - it's your architectural partner that sees, hears, and responds in real-time."

**Call to Action**

*Visuals:*
- Final branding shot with logo
- Competition category: "Live Agents - Gemini Live Agent Challenge"
- GitHub repository URL
- Live demo URL

*Voiceover:*
"The future of AI-assisted design is here. Real-time, interactive, and privacy-focused. Architectural Alchemist - transforming spaces, one conversation at a time."
